## The basics {.smaller}

* Title: Variation In provision of Education support to Survivors of childhood cancer and Their Attainment (VIESTA) 
* Applicant: Tony Stone, CHIG, Clinical Epidemiology, Nutrition and Biostatistics, PPP, UCL GOSH ICH
* Supporters (not funded):
    * Prof Katie Harron (primary mentor), ECHILD PI, CHIG, PPP, UCL GOSH ICH
    * Prof Lorrain Dearden, IOE, UCL
    * Dr Defne Saatci, Clinical Research Fellow, Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, Oxford
    * Ms Christine Farquharson, Associate Director, Institute for Fiscal Studies
* Funder: ADR UK / ESRC
* Duration / Cost: 18 month (70% 15months; 40% 3months) / ~£160k (max £175k) @ fEC (80% funded)

## Background 1/2

* 1,600 children (under-15years) diagnosed with cancer each year in England.
* Survivors likely to have experienced disruption to their normal activities (e.g. school)
* Long-term effects on their physical and psychological functioning
* Academic attainment strongly associated with:
    * employment opportunities
    * lifetime earnings
    * self-perceived subjective social position

## Background 2/2

* Survivors of childhood cancer face barriers to academic learning:
    * absence from school
    * physical and cognitive effects
    * psychosocial effects
* JLA priority: Effective interventions to support those returning to education
* NAO called for investigation into substantial unexplained local variation in the provision of support for SEND

## Study Aims

1. Quantify impact of childhood cancer on academic attainment of survivors
1. Quantify impact of childhood cancer on academic attainment of siblings
1. Identify school-level characteristics associated with reduced attainment differences

## Experimental approach 1/6

* Data source: ECHILD research database
* Co-produced with Teenage Cancer Trust Youth Advisory group
    * Variable selection
    * Interpretation of results
    * Dissemination

## Experimental approach 2/6

* Population:
    1. all children enrolled in state-funded schools in England at any time in the period 2014 to 2022
        1. 5+ years school attendance records preceding KS2/4 outcome
        2. a birth record and complete school attendance record
    2. Siblings cohort: Use the subgroup of 1.2, those with an identified siblings (sharing the same biological mother)

## Experimental approach 3/6

* Exposure: 
    1. Diagnosis of any cancer prior to KS2/4 outcome
    2. Prior to KS2/4 outcome, having a child sibling (0-16years) diagnosed with any cancer 

## Experimental approach 4/6

* Comparison:
    1. Peers (defined as those with similar baseline characteristics, such as cohort, age, 
    gender, ethnicity and small geography based deprivation) with no previous diagnosis of cancer
    2. Peers with no previous diagnosis of cancer, and with a child or adolescent (aged 0-16years) 
    sibling (sharing the same mother) with no previous diagnosis of cancer.

## Experimental approach 5/6 {.smaller}

* Outcomes: 
    * Meeting the expected standard in Key Stage (KS) 2 reading, writing and maths (binary) 
    * Number of KS4 [GCSE] passes at grade A* to C (count) 
    * Receipt of special educational needs and disabilities support (binary) - repeated for all years for which data are available 
    * Number of days absent (count) - repeated for all years for which data are available 
    * Post-16 outcomes such as:
        * continuing education into KS5
        * total points achieved from best three results at KS5 [A-level]. 

## Experimental approach 6/6

* Prognostic variables prospectively identified by review of literature (previous studies: age, gender, FSM, SEND, EAL). 
* DAG representations of causal relationships to inform the development of regression models. 
* crude outcomes for both exposure groups
* doubly robust methods to adjust for (measured) baseline confounders (augmented inverse propensity weighted estimators)

::: {.notes}
This combines a regression adjustment (RA) model (i.e., a regression model conditional on suitable covariates) 
with inverse propensity weighting (IPW) to obtain an unbiased exposure effect estimator provided either or both 
the RA and IPW models are correctly specified​.

For Outcomes 1 (KS2 expected standard met), the RA model 
will be a binary logistic model yielding an odds ratio describing the association of the outcome and exposure. 
For Outcome 2 (KS4 count of A*-C passes), the RA model will likely be a negative binomial model yielding an 
incident rate ratio describing the association of the outcome and exposure.

Due to the repeated measurements in Outcomes 3 & 4 (repeated each year for which data are available per pupil), 
I will use doubly robust Generalised Estimating Equation (GEE) methods to allow for the within-pupil correlation 

For the sub-cohorts for which both KS2 and KS4 outcomes are present, I will investigate fitting models 
estimating Outcome 2 (KS4 attainment) conditional on KS2 outcome, in addition to identified covariates. 

RQ3: I will use generalised linear mixed (multi-level) models to investigate how much of the variation in outcomes 
(for Outcome 1 & 2, KS2/4 attainment) between exposure groups is explained by observations being clustered within 
schools and the school-level characteristics. It is the likely the data will be relatively sparse (few pupils per school) 
for this analysis, if so, Bayesian mixed modelling approaches will be investigated.
